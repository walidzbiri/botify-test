# Botify technical test

The test is about creating an app that shows visualizations of data (almost shippable).
The data displayed will be fetched from NASA’s NeoWs (Near Earth Object Web Service).
The test consists of the following steps:

* [Step 1] Create a React application
* [Step 1] Fetch data from NASA’s API
* [Step 1] Display that data in a chart using Google Charts
* [Step 2] Implement a user input used to filter the data in your chart
* [Step 3] Implement a Table view of the data with a view switcher
* [Step BONUS] Implement a “CSV Download” button
* [Step BONUS] Reimplement your components in Hooks vs Classes

## Project workflow
Each step is a new branch. At the end of each step, I create a Pull Request for the branch
to explain what’s been done in the step. Then merge it with the main (master) branch. Each branch is created from the main branch.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available scripts

Install all project dependencies in package.json
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!
